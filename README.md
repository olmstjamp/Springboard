# Springboard

Welcome to my portfolio! This portfolio contains most of my Springboard cirriculum assignments and my two Capstone projects. The first Capstone is a custering project based on responses to a longitudinal politial survey, and the second is a fake news classifier. README files for each of those projects are in the folders Clustering_American_Electorate and Fake_News_Classifier respectively. The other folders contain smaller projects assigned by Springboard.
